MathCarRace is a mathematical game that simulates a car race.
It is based on vectors drawn on squared paper and for people who like geometry and vectors.

Aim of the game is to drive a track as fast as possible, i.e. with as few vectors as possible.

The car movement on the track is based on vectors and each vector is determined by the previous vector.
The previous vector is prolonged to determine the next middle point.
The next vector can end in the middle point or in one of the 8 surrounding neighbor grid points.
 
Be careful not to go too fast, if you choose too long vectors you will be "thrown" off the track.

Features:
- Race on predefined tracks
- Race on a random track
- Race on own created and saved tracks
- Let the computer drive a race track with different drive modes (careful, risky, ...)
