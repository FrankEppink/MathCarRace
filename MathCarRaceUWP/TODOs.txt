computer driver
===============
top driver
----------
- calculating all possible curves, taking the best simply brute force will not work, too many possibilities?
- brute force with the quadrant direction check possibly... -> for each step only a choice between 3 directions instead of up to 7 directions
possibly use score-system, give scores to grid points and select the one with the maximum
- when switched to in a dead-end it is stuck in an infinite loop

risky driver
------------
- still fails sometimes at random maps, but not important?

user paints track
=================
User creates/paints own track - base approach on polygons...
1. Let user draw outer curve, with constraints that
- left point of starting line is constant? Not sure if this is necessary
- curve must include center of area
- display and only activate the area to the user where he is allowed to draw curves, do not accept click/input in the invalid area

2. Let user draw inner curve with constraints that
- inner curve always has a minimum distance from the already available outer curve
- inner curve must also include center of area

3. Then sample the available pixels into polygons 

Save own created tracks

MVP until here ------ publish in store -----------------------------------------

- check for publish validity into Windows Store

Different displays/platforms
============================
- windows phone
- windows RT tablet (forget it!)

Highscore
---------
Save own highscore per track

random polygon tracks
=====================
- are they random enough?
- inner polygon also needs to obey the constraint of the outer polygon - seems to be fulfilled by chance?
- end of outer curve must fit to start of outer curve
with the increased percentage intervals no real problem anymore...

Layout / GUI
============
Button for computer driver on/off and combo box for driver modi are not nice
- they should not change position, when clicked on
- they should have the same size

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement if vector on track and not only is endpoint of new vector on track?
- game still works without this constraints

Test-Explorer
continuous Integration konfigurieren...
only works with TFS?

introduce options?
- user can switch of candidate grid point marking
- user can select speed of computer
- user can ...?

study
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide

- introduce different cars (with different vector possibilities: acceleration at start, acceleration and braking during race...)

- save races/routes?
-- together with high scores?
-- IRoute = collection of grid points

- two players against each other?

- use Linq expressions and replace for loops

- GridBackground.xaml(.cs)
user binding, e.g. for the string
use MVVM
