Bugs for Created Track 05
=========================
/// <summary>
/// ray casting algorithm
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon#Ray_casting_algorithm
/// </summary>
private static bool Contains(Polygon polygon, Point location)
fails for outer polygon and does not accept valid grid points

Also the computer driver leaves the track, probably the same cause

Also occurs for other created tracks but less often...

Scale to window size
====================
It would be great if the window scaled with the current window size, i.e. the canvas gets smaller so that always the complete picture is displayed.
Alternatively add scrollbar so that when not all elements are visible the user can use the scrollbar ... ugly
What is the use case of this feature? Support Windows Mobile? See below...

Touchscreen support
===================
implement zooming and sliding (for touchscreens only...)

see also samples at
	D:\10 Tools\WindowsAppDevelopment\UWP\Windows-universal-samples-master

Windows 10 Mobile
=================
Current problems on Windows 10 Mobile
- only the upper left corner is shown, it is not possible to slide to the other parts
- zooming is also not possible, this would enable selection of gridpoint...
- it is not possible to select the desired grid point, calculation is wrong?
- such small displays are hard to handle, check the views in the "Visual Studio - device preview toolbar""

- Try to install directly if I have done changes

Error at installation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout & Design
===============
Drive mode combo box 
- background color

track loading and saving
========================
at initial load the path where the track files are located should be used
to be checked on initial start on a different device...
are the track files actually installed on the target device and if yes where

link mcr file extension with MathCarRace App
- permission problem with app in sandbox
- let user decide if he wants that, could be that another app already has a file extension link and that the user wants to keep that.

computer driver
===============
top driver
----------
- calculating all possible curves, taking the best simply brute force will not work, too many possibilities?
- brute force with the quadrant direction check possibly... -> for each step only a choice between 3 directions instead of up to 7 directions
possibly use score-system, give scores to grid points and select the one with the maximum
- determine optimum based on the current length of the vector?
-- short vector, e.g. length 2 -> compare only the next 2 steps
-- long vector, e.g. length 4 -> compare the next 4 steps

- base approach on inner curve and its movement
-- determine those grid points that are closest to the inner curve, only choose among them 
-- base each movement vector (direction and length) on the direction and length of the inner curve

- bug: when switched to in a dead-end it is stuck in an infinite loop

risky driver
------------
- still fails sometimes at random maps, but not important?

random polygon tracks
=====================
- are they random enough?
- inner polygon also needs to obey the constraint of the outer polygon - seems to be fulfilled by chance?
- end of outer curve must fit to start of outer curve
with the increased percentage intervals no real problem anymore...

user paints track (GridBackgroundTrackCreation)
===============================================
bug: starting line not completely correct, sometimes starting line grid points are outside but still can be clicked on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement if vector on track and not only is endpoint of new vector on track?
- game still works without this constraints

introduce options?
- user can switch of candidate grid point marking
- user can select speed of computer
- user can ...?

- introduce different cars (with different vector possibilities: acceleration at start, acceleration and braking during race...)

- save races/routes?
-- together with high scores?
-- IRoute = collection of grid points

- two players against each other?

Techno Stuff
------------
- use Linq expressions and replace for loops

- GridBackground.xaml(.cs)
user binding, e.g. for the string
use MVVM

- Test-Explorer
continuous Integration konfigurieren...
only works with TFS?
