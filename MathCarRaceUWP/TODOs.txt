Error at installation

Current problems on Windows 10 Mobile
- only the upper left corner is shown, it is not possible to slide to the other parts
- zooming is also not possible, this would enable selection of gridpoint...
- it is not possible to select the desired grid point, calculation is wrong?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

track loading and saving
========================
at initial load the path where the track files are located should be used
to be checked on initial start on a different device...
are the track files actually installed on the target device and if yes where

computer driver
===============
top driver
----------
- deactivate before publishing if not fixed...

- calculating all possible curves, taking the best simply brute force will not work, too many possibilities?
- brute force with the quadrant direction check possibly... -> for each step only a choice between 3 directions instead of up to 7 directions
possibly use score-system, give scores to grid points and select the one with the maximum
- determine optimum based on the current length of the vector?
-- short vector, e.g. length 2 -> compare only the next 2 steps
-- long vector, e.g. length 4 -> compare the next 4 steps

- base approach on inner curve and its movement
-- determine those grid points that are closest to the inner curve, only choose among them 
-- base each movement vector (direction and length) on the direction and length of the inner curve

- bug: when switched to in a dead-end it is stuck in an infinite loop

risky driver
------------
- still fails sometimes at random maps, but not important?

Highscore
---------
Save own highscore per track

random polygon tracks
=====================
- are they random enough?
- inner polygon also needs to obey the constraint of the outer polygon - seems to be fulfilled by chance?
- end of outer curve must fit to start of outer curve
with the increased percentage intervals no real problem anymore...

Layout / GUI
============
Button for computer driver on/off and combo box for driver modi are not nice
- they should not change position, when clicked on
- they should have the same size
- it should be clearer how to switch the computer driver on and off

user paints track (GridBackgroundTrackCreation)
===============================================
bug: starting line not completely correct, sometimes starting line grid points are outside but still can be clicked on

Windows RT tablet
=================
not available in Store

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement if vector on track and not only is endpoint of new vector on track?
- game still works without this constraints

Test-Explorer
continuous Integration konfigurieren...
only works with TFS?

introduce options?
- user can switch of candidate grid point marking
- user can select speed of computer
- user can ...?

- introduce different cars (with different vector possibilities: acceleration at start, acceleration and braking during race...)

- save races/routes?
-- together with high scores?
-- IRoute = collection of grid points

- two players against each other?

- use Linq expressions and replace for loops

- GridBackground.xaml(.cs)
user binding, e.g. for the string
use MVVM
