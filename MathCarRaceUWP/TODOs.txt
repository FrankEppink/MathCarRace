an additional real track, nr 03

- check for publish validity into Windows Store

MVP until here ------ publish in store -----------------------------------------

Different displays/platforms
============================
- windows phone
- windows RT tablet

computer driver
===============
- top driver - calculating all possible curves, taking the best
simply brute force will not work, too many possibilities?
- brute force with the quadrant direction check possibly... -> for each step only a choice between 3 directions instead of up to 7 directions
possibly use score-system, give scores to grid points and select the one with the maximum

- risky driver
-- still fails sometimes at random maps

user paints track
=================
instead of fiddling around with random polygon tracks forever,
better have user paint a track?
Must be based on polygons...
- create own track
-- Constraints to make validation easier
--- left point of starting line is constant, let user choose a width first
--- outer and inner curve
--- middle point of canvas lies inside inner curve 
- save own created tracks

- highscore?
-- save own highscore per track

random polygon tracks
=====================
- are they random enough?
- inner polygon also needs to obey the constraint of the outer polygon.
seems to be fulfilled by chance?
- end of outer curve must fit to start of outer curve
with the increased percentage intervals no real problem anymore...

Layout / GUI
============
Button for computer driver on/off and combo box for driver modi are not nice
- they should not change position, when clicked on
- they should have the same size

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once I managed to get the computer driver throw an exception on Track 05, changing wildly between on/off and the different modi

Implement if vector on track and not only is endpoint of new vector on track?
- game still works without this constraints

Test-Explorer
continuous Integration konfigurieren...
only works with TFS?

introduce options?
- user can switch of candidate grid point marking
- user can select speed of computer
- user can ...?

- introduce different cars (with different vector possibilities: acceleration at start, acceleration and braking during race...)

- save races/routes?
-- together with high scores?
-- IRoute = collection of grid points

- two players against each other?

- use Linq expressions and replace for loops

- GridBackground.xaml(.cs)
user binding, e.g. for the string
use MVVM
