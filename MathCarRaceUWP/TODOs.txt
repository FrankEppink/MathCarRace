- risky driver
-- still fails sometimes at random maps


- beautify
-- get nice background image for inner part - use meadow.jpg instead of green solid color
-- outer part... has a cool image but it is not mine... replace with a free to use image
-- track has more nicer brush?
-- get nice image for the outer part - audience
-- get logos
-- after race is finished, make a car race the chosen track...animation...

explanation on first side
- beautify, bad reading currently



- check for publish validity into Windows Store


MVP until here ------ publish in store -----------------------------------------

- test on other platforms?
-- windows phone
-- windows RT tablet

- top driver - calculating all possible curves, taking the best
simply brute force will not work, too many possibilities?
- brute force with the quadrant direction check possibly... -> for each step only a choice between 3 directions instead of up to 7 directions
possibly use score-system, give scores to grid points and select the one with the maximum


random polygon tracks
=====================
- are they random enough?
- inner polygon also needs to obey the constraint of the outer polygon.
seems to be fulfilled by chance?
- end of outer curve must fit to start of outer curve
with the increased percentage intervals no real problem anymore...

user paints track
=================
instead of fiddling around with random polygon tracks forever,
better have user paint a track?
Must be based on polygons...
- create own track
-- Constraints to make validation easier
--- left point of starting line is constant, let user choose a width first
--- outer and inner curve
--- middle point of canvas lies inside inner curve 








Implement if vector on track and not only is endpoint of new vector on track?

- beautify
-- after race is finished, make a car race the chosen track...animation...

Test-Explorer
continuous Integration konfigurieren...
only works with TFS

options
- user can switch of candidate grid point marking
- user can select speed of computer
- user can ...?

study

- introduce different cars (with different vector possibilities: acceleration at start, acceleration and braking during race...)

- highscore?

- save races/routes?
-- together with high scores?
-- IRoute = collection of grid points

- save own created tracks

- two players against each other?

- use Linq expressions and replace for loops

- GridBackground.xaml(.cs)
user binding, e.g. for the string
use MVVM
