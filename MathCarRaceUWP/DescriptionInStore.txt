MathCarRace is a mathematical game that simulates a car race.
I learned it in my math class in school a long time ago and now programmed it as an app and hope you like it.
So it is more a vector based math game, than a fancy car game.
Aim of the game is to drive a track as fast as possible, i.e. with as few vectors as possible.

The car movement on the track is based on vectors and each move is determined by the previous vector.
The previous vector is prolonged and the car can move to one of 9 grid points, i.e. the end of the prolonged vector and its 8 surrounding neighbors.
Be careful not to go too fast, if you choose too long vectors you will be "thrown" off the track.

Features:
- Race on predefined tracks
- Race on a random track
- Race on own created and saved tracks
- Let the computer drive a race track with different drive Modi (carefully, risky, ...)
