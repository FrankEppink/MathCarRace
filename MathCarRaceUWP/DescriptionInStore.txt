Math Car Race is a mathematical game that simulates a car race.
I learned it in my math class in school a long time ago and programmed it as an app.
So it is more a math game, than a car game.

The car movement on the tracks are based on vectors and each move is determined by the previous vector.
Most of the times the next movement can be selected out of 9 grid points.
The 9 grid points consist out of the the previous vector prolonged and the surrounding neighbor grid points.
Be careful not to go too fast, i.e. choose too long vectors or otherwise you will not stay on the track.

Features:
- Race on predefined tracks
- Race on a random track
- Race on own created and saved tracks
- Let the computer drive a race track with different drive Modi (careful, risky, ...)
